<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER I. EXPLAINING HOW AN ELECTRIC MOTOR OPERATES. SOME PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETISM. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHUNT AND A SERIES MOTOR.</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><strong class="bold">An Electric Motor</strong><span> is a device for transforming
electricity into mechanical power. A
generator, or dynamo, is constructed in almost the same
identical manner as a motor but its purpose is just the
opposite. A dynamo transforms </span><strong class="bold">mechanical power into
electricity</strong><span>. A dynamo produces electric current, but a
motor </span><strong class="bold">consumes</strong><span> it. Some machines can be used either
as a motor or dynamo—not all however.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Of course most experimenters have in all probability
seen many electric motors, but it is more than likely
that the exact operation is not thoroughly understood.
Here is your chance to learn.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The little motors described in this book can each be
made in two or three hours out of a few scraps of sheet
iron, magnet wire and screws. The cost of the
necessary materials is practically negligible.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One of the main advantages of these little motors is
that they illustrate the actual principles that are used
in the large motors, such as are employed everywhere
for practicable power purposes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The iron parts may be made out of sheet iron or the
ordinary so-called "tin" used in cocoa cans, etc. Thin
tin can be cut with an ordinary pair of shears. Sheet
iron such as is used in making stovepipes, etc., is an
excellent material to use in making these little motors.
Sheet iron is usually heavier than tin and will have to
be cut with a pair of "snips." Greater skill will also
then be required in bending the parts. It is worth
while noting however, that the extra difficulty involved
in using the heavier material is worth the trouble
because it makes possible a more powerful and efficient
motor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The first and easiest type of motor to make is the
"Simplex."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Principle on which an Electric Motor Operates</strong><span>
is really very simple. If a current of electricity is
passed through a copper wire, the wire will attract to
itself iron filings, etc., as long as the current continues
to flow. As soon as the current is shut off, the filings
drop away because the magnetism immediately
disappears with the cessation of the current.</span></p>

<span class="italics">FIG. 1.—If a current of electricity is passed through a wire, the wire will attract to itself iron filings.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>If a wire, carrying a current of electricity is formed
into a loop, the entire space enclosed by the loop will
possess the properties of a magnet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>By forming the wire into several loops or a spiral
the combined effect of all the individual turns is
concentrated in a small space and a much more powerful
field is produced. If the coil is provided with an iron
core, the magnetism is much more concentrated and
will exercise a very powerful attractive effect upon any
neighboring masses of iron or steel. Such a coil is
called an electromagnet.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>Electromagnets play a very important part in the
construction of electric motors. The strength of an
electro magnetic coil is proportional to its ampere
turns. The number of ampere turns in a coil is
obtained by multiplying the number of amperes flowing
through the coil by the number of turns of wire
composing it.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>You can easily see the effect of turns of wire on an
electromagnet by winding two or three turns of wire
around a nail and connecting it to a battery. These
two or three turns will probably create enough
magnetism to enable the nail to lift up one or two ordinary
carpet tacks.</span></p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 100%" id="figure-855">
<img class="align-center block" style="display: block; width: 100%; width: 85.0%" alt="FIG 4—The strength of an electromagnet is proportional to the ampere turns." src="images/Image4.jpg" />
<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">FIG 4—The strength of an electromagnet is proportional to the ampere turns. The magnet illustrated above does not possess sufficient turns to be very strong.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then increase the number of turns to forty or fifty
and note that the magnetism of the nail has increased
greatly and that it now possesses power to pick up a
larger number of tacks at a time.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>From this one may be led to believe that the more
turns of wire an electromagnet possesses, the stronger
it will be, and while to a certain extent this is true,
it should be remembered that it is not simply </span><strong class="bold">turns</strong><span>
that count but </span><strong class="bold">ampere turns</strong><span> and if the number of
turns of wire is increased beyond a certain point the
resistance of the coil to the electric current will
become so great that the current in amperes flowing
through the coil is greatly reduced and consequently
also the magnetism is decreased.</span></p>

<img class="align-center block" style="display: block; width: 100%; width: 85.0%" alt="FIG. 5.—An increase in the number of turns of wire has resulted in considerable increase in the magnetism and this magnet is able to lift a much greater weight than that shown in Figure 4." src="images/Image5.jpg" />

<span class="italics">FIG. 5.—An increase in the number of turns of wire has resulted in considerable increase in the magnetism and this magnet is able to lift a much greater weight than that shown in Figure 4.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>It will be found that the magnetism of an
electromagnet is strongest at the ends. These places are
called the poles.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If you bring one pole of a small electromagnet,
formed by winding a nail with a few turns of wire,
near a compass needle, you will find that it will attract
one end of the compass needle and repel the other. The
end of the compass needle which points North is called
a </span><strong class="bold">North</strong><span> pole. The ends of the electromagnet which
attracts the North pole of the compass needle is a
</span><strong class="bold">South</strong><span> pole.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One of the most important laws of magnetism is that
like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract
each other. A North and a South pole therefore tend
to pull toward each other, whereas two North poles
or two South poles repel one another.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>Each end of the armature winding is connected to
one half of a brass ring called the commutator and
marked "C, C," in the illustration. The two halves of
the commutator are insulated from each other and are
mounted on the armature shaft so that they revolve
together with the armature.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The armature revolves between the ends of a
horseshoe shaped piece of iron called the field. The field is
also wound with a coil of wire called the </span><strong class="bold">field winding</strong><span>
or sometimes the field coil.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The armature and the field are both electromagnets.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two strips of copper, "B, B," bear against the
commutator. These are the </span><strong class="bold">brushes</strong><span>, and their purpose is
to lead the current to the armature coil.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One brush is connected to one end of the field coil.
The other end of the field coil and the other brush are
connected to a source of electric current.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As soon as the current is turned on, the armature
and the field both become magnets. The North pole
of the field attracts the South pole of the armature and
vice-versa. The armature starts to move so that the
poles will come opposite but as the commutator moves
around and is turned over, the current flows through
the armature coil in the opposite direction. This
reverses the magnetism of the armature and that which
was the South pole become the North pole and
vice-versa.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>The armature poles will therefore have to move 180
degrees in order that the South pole may come
opposite the North pole of the field. Before it gets there,
however, the commutator will have turned over again,
reversing the current in the armature and making it
necessary to continue its journey again. This process
keeps up and so the armature revolves always trying
to seek a new position which it is prevented from
remaining at by the action of the commutator.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Motors are said to be series or shunt wound
depending on whether all the current flowing through the
armature also passes through the field or whether it
divides between the two as shown in Figure 7.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>The field of the motor is of the type known as the
"simplex" while the armature is the "Siemen’s H" or
two-pole type. The field and the armature are cut
from ordinary tin-plated iron, such as is used in the
manufacture of tin cans and cracker boxes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The simplest method of securing good flat material

operations are finished. Mark a line carefully across
the center of each strip. Then taking care to keep
the shape symmetrical so that both pieces are exactly

The small bend in the center is most easily made by
bending the strip over a knitting-needle and then

be taken to make the bearings accurately so that the

should be soldered to the shaft as shown in Figure 13.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Commutator Core</strong><span> is formed by cutting a strip
of paper three-eighths of an inch wide and about five
inches long. It should be given a coat of shellac on
one side and allowed to dry until it gets sticky. The
strip is then wrapped around the shaft until its
diameter is three-sixteenths of an inch. The sticky shellac
should be sufficient to hold the paper tightly in position

field should be insulated with paper in this manner.
The armature is insulated in exactly the same way,
taking care that the paper covers the entire flat portion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The field and armature are now ready for winding.
It is necessary to take proper precautions to prevent
the first turn from slipping out of place.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The field should be wound first. This is
accomplished by looping a small piece of tape or cord over
it at the point indicated by "A" in Figure 15. The
next two turns are then taken over the ends of the
loop so as to embed them. Wind on three layers of
wire on one side and then run the wire across to the
other side and wind on three layers there. The third
layer of wire in the second coil should end at "B." It
should be fastened into position by a loop of string

<p class="pfirst"><span>The form of "Simplex" motor which has just been
described has only one drawback which prevents it
from being a first class motor in every respect, namely,
the armature has only two poles and the motor is
therefore not self-starting, but must be given a twist
with the fingers in order to start it rotating. A
Two-pole armature is the easiest for the young experimenter
to make and that is the reason that it has been
described first.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All large power motors are provided with armatures
having a large number of poles so as to be self-starting
and to give as steady a pull as possible.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Armature</strong><span>—The method of making a three-pole
armature is practically the same as that of making one
having only two poles. Three strips of tin, one-half
an inch by one and one-half inches are necessary.
They are purposely made a little longer than is actually
required in order to form the armature and are cut to
length after the finish of the bending operations.</span></p>

Then bend them into the shape shown in Figure 20,
taking care to keep the shape symmetrical so that all
three pieces are exactly alike. The bend in the center

S. Gauge, double cotton-covered. Single cotton-covered
wire for this purpose is liable to give trouble on
account of short circuits.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In order to wind the armature, cut three pieces of
wire about three and one-half feet long. Wrap a strip
of paper around each section of the armature so that
the sharp edges of the tin will not cut through the
insulation on the wire and then wind four layers of wire
on each section of the armature.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Field Magnet</strong><span> is exactly like that used in
making the Simplex motor with the two-pole armature.
It is made by first cutting out a strip of tin five-eighths
of an inch wide by five inches long and then bending
it into the shape shown in Figures 10 and 11. The
easiest way of doing this with reasonable accuracy is
to cut out a piece of wood for a form and then bend
the tin over the form.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two small holes should be bored in the feet of the
field magnet so as to enable the field to be fastened to
the base.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The field is wound with the same size of wire used
on the armature. The winding is started by looping
a small piece of tape or cord over the frame at the
point indicated by "A" in Figure 15. The next two
turns are then wound over the ends of the loop so as
to hold them down. Wind on three layers of wire on
one side and then run the wire across to the other
side and wind on three layers there. The third layer
of wire in the second coil should end at B. It should
be fastened in position by a loop of string so that it will
not unwind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This method divides the field winding into two parts,
both of which are connected together. The outside
layer of the first coil is connected to the inside layer
of the second coil. The two coils really form one
continuous winding divided into two parts. The
illustration in Figure 23 should make this clear. After the
winding is finished, give it a coat of shellac.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Bearings</strong><span> are shown in detail in Figure 12.
They are easily made. Care should be taken to make
the bearings very accurate so that the armature will
be in the proper position when the motor is assembled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two small washers, serving as collars to bear against
the inside of the bearings and keep the armature in the
field should be soldered to the shaft as shown in
Figure 13.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Base</strong><span> is cut from any ordinary piece of wood
and should be in the form of a rectangular block about
two and one-half inches by one and seven-eighths
inches wide, and one-half inch thick.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The completed motor is shown in Figure 24. Be
sure that the armature does not scrape against the
field at any point but clears it by about one-sixteenth
of an inch all around. The brushes are fastened under
a small clamp made from a strip of tin held down at
each end by a small wood screw. The brushes are
made by flattening the end of a piece of copper wire
with a few light hammer blows. The brushes can be
best adjusted under actual working conditions when
the current is passing through the motor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One end of the field winding is connected to the
brush marked "C," in Figure 24. The other brush,
"A" and the other end of the field winding, "B," form
the terminals to which the battery is connected. This
forms what is known as a series connected motor,
because the armature and the field are in series and the
current must pass from one to the other.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>Figure 25 shows a form of motor which is essentially
the same as that shown in Figure 24 except that the
field has been turned upside down and the armature
is at the top of the motor instead of the bottom.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>The detailed dimensions of the field are shown in
Figure 26. It is made by cutting out a. strip of tin
five-eighths of an inch wide and five inches long.
This strip is then bent into the shape shown in Figures

that shown in Figure 15 except that the two feet are
omitted and it has been turned upside down. The
method of making ft is the same.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Those readers who have made the motors already
described, are no doubt anxious to proceed with the
construction of some models which bear a greater
resemblance to the large motors commonly employed to
furnish power.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Figure 29 shows a motor of the "Manchester" type.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Field</strong><span> of this machine is made from a strip of
heavy sheet tin, one-half inch wide and about six inches
long, bent to shape and joined in the center of the
bottom pole piece, just above the pedestal. It is best
to cut the strip a little long and then reduce it to the
exact length required after the bending operations have
been finished. The illustration in Figure 30 shows the
details and dimensions of the field.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The field should be bent into shape with the aid of
a pair of pliers and a wooden form, in the same manner
employed in making the motors already described.</span></p>

<span class="italics">FIG. 28.—The Manchester Motor.</span></div>

<p class="pnext"><span>The field frame is supported by a "pedestal." The
pedestal is formed by another strip, one-half inch wide,
soldered to the field at right angles, underneath the
joint in the lower pole piece.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The pedestal should be firmly soldered to the field,
care being taken to see that the solder runs well into
the joints. Then bend the ends of the pedestal down to
form two "feet" as shown in the illustration. The
feet should be bent so as to bring the center of the
armature tunnel five-eighths of an inch above the base.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two small holes should be bored in the pedestal, at
each side, so that the motor can be screwed fast to a
wooden base.</span></p>

<span class="italics">FIG. 30.—Details of the Field Frame.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Winding the Field</strong><span>—It will be necessary to proceed
with the winding of this motor in a slightly different
manner from that followed in making the other motors.
The wire cannot be wound on as easily as before and
it will be necessary to wind the required length of wire
onto a small spool or bobbin, which can be passed
through the field. Double cotton-covered wire is the
best for the purpose. Either No. 25 or No. 26 B. &amp; S.
Gauge may be used. A strip of paper should be
wrapped around the field frame at all points where the
wire is liable to touch, so as to guard the insulation
against possible abrasion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Figure 32 shows the method which should be
followed in winding the coils. Both parts of the winding
should be started at the bottom of the field and wound
in the direction indicated. "B" and "D" are the
starting ends Wind on three layers of wire in each coil.
The terminals, "B" and "C," should be connected
together after the winding is finished.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Armature</strong><span>—The method of making the armature
is exactly the same as that which has already been
described. Three strips of tin, one-half inch wide and
one and one-half inches long are required. They are
purposely made slightly longer than is actually
necessary and are cut to length after the finish of the
bending operations.</span></p>

the three strips and then bend them into the shape
shown in Figure 20, making certain to keep the shape
symmetrical so that all three, pieces are exactly alike.
The bend in the center of each strip should fit nicely
over the shaft. This result is most easily reached by
bending the strips over a knitting-needle and then
bending them back the required amount.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Shaft</strong><span> is a piece of knitting-needle one and
seven-eighths of an inch long. Assemble the three strips on
the shaft as shown in Figure 21 and bind them
temporarily together with a piece of iron wire. Then
solder the edges together and remove the wire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Commutator Core</strong><span> is formed of a strip of paper,
three-eighths of an inch wide and about five inches
long, wrapped around the shaft until the diameter of
the small cylinder thus formed is three-sixteenths of
an inch. The paper strip should be given a coat of
shellac on one side and allowed to dry until it
becomes sticky before it is wrapped around the shaft.
The sticky shellac should be sufficient to hold the
paper tightly in position when dry and to form a hard,
firm core when dry.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Winding of the Armature</strong><span> is not difficult. The
size of the wire used should be No. 25 or No. 26 B. &amp;
S. Gauge, double cotton-covered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Wrap a strip of paper around each section of the
armature so that the wire will be protected from any
sharp edges on the tin which might cut through the
insulation.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Wind four layers of wire on each section of the
armature. Each section should be wound in the same
direction as the others. The terminals of the wires
should be scraped clean and connected together in the
following manner: Connect the outside end of one
section to the inside end of the next section. We will
presume that the three sections of the armature are
lettered "A", "B" and "C." Connect the outside end of
"A" to the inside of "B"; the outside of "B" to the
inside end of "C" and the outside end of "G" to the
inside of "A."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The portion of the wires forming the connections
between the three armature coils are used to form the
three sections of the commutator.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Bend the wires so that they will fit closely to the
paper core and bind them tightly into position with
silk thread.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">Two Bearings</strong><span> are required to support the armature.
They are cut out of sheet iron or brass and are shown
in detail in Figure 12. Extra care should be exercised
in making the bearings to insure their accuracy so that
the armature will be in the proper position when the
motor is assembled and run freely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two small washers or wire rings, to serve as collars
and keep the armature in the center of the field, should
be soldered to the shaft as shown in Figure 22.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Base</strong><span> is a square block of wood, two and
one-half inches wide, two and one-half inches long and
three-eighths of an inch thick.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The completed Manchester motor is shown in Figure
29. The brushes are made by flattening the ends of
two pieces of copper wire. Each brush is fastened
under a small clamp made from a strip of tin held down
at each end by a small round-headed wood screw.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Be sure that the armature is exactly in the center of
the field, does not scrape at any point and turns
perfectly freely.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The armature and the field windings should be
connected in series. The terminals of the field marked
"B" in Figure 32 should be connected to the brush
clamp marked "C" in Figure 29. The terminal of the
field marked "C" in Figure 32 forms one terminal of
the motor. The other is the brush clamp "A."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Oil the bearings of the motor, adjust the brushes and
it will be ready to run.</span></p>

fibre five-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and
seven-sixteenths of an inch long. Split the tube, into three
equal parts by dividing it longitudinally with a
hacksaw. Make a fibre ring which will force onto the tube
very tightly when it is in position on the fibre core

<h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>HOW TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENTAL INDUCTION MOTOR.</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>A motor having a three-pole armature will run
on alternating current as well as on direct current
and can be operated on the 110 volt A. C. current in
series with a suitable resistance. The average
experimenter is probably aware of this but did you know that
it can also be operated on alternating current as an
</span><strong class="bold">induction motor</strong><span> and that it will then run </span><strong class="bold">without brushes</strong><span>
and without current being led into the armature?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In order to make an induction motor out of an
ordinary three-pole battery motor such as that shown
in Figure 48 it is merely necessary to remove the
brushes and bind a piece of bare copper wire around
the commutator so that it short circuits the segments.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The alternating current should be led into the field
coil. A step down transformer will prove very useful
for producing a low voltage alternating current which
may be connected directly to the field coil. If a
transformer is not available, the 110 v. alternating current
can be used, provided that a proper resistance such
as a lamp bank, be placed in series with the motor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>If the current is turned on and the armature is then
speeded up by giving it a couple of sharp twists, or
winding a string around the shaft and then pulling it
as one would spin a top, the motor will continue to
revolve at a good rate of speed.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>It may prove easier to start the motor if the
armature is speeded up before the current is turned on.
As soon as a good speed is reached, turn on the
current and the armature should continue to run.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Commercial induction motors are self starting, and
are provided with a hollow armature, which contains
a centrifugal governor. When the motor is at rest
or starting, four brushes press against the commutator
and divide the armature coils into four groups. After
the motor has attained the proper speed the governor
is thrown out by centrifugal force and pushes the
brushes away from the commutator. At the same time
a metal ring is pressed against the interior of the
commutator, short circuiting all the sections and making
each coil a complete circuit of itself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It would be very difficult to provide a small
three-pole toy motor with such a governor and
short-circuiting device in order to make it self-starting.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It is however possible to accomplish this in another
way, by a very simple device.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This consists in providing the armature with
another set of coils for use in starting only. The brushes
are allowed to remain on the motor but are only used
for starting. The leads of the armature winding are
removed from the commutator and are all connected
together. Then two or three layers of wire are wound
over the coils to form new coils which are similar to
the old ones but smaller.</span></p>

complete the arrangements. The connections should
be made as in Figure 49. The switch should be thrown
to the right, on contact A, for starting so that the
current flows through the field and through the extra
coils on the armature in the ordinary way. As soon
as the motor has reached its speed, throw the switch
to the left so that the current flows through the field
only and the motor will continue to run by induction.</span></p>

<h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>HOW TO BUILD AN ELECTRIC ENGINE</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span>An electric engine is really a form of electric motor
but differs from the most common form of the latter
in that the armature, instead of revolving, oscillates
back and forth, like the piston of a steam or gasoline
engine. Electric engines are not as efficient as electric
motors from the standpoint of the amount of power
delivered in proportion to the current used, but they
make very interesting models and the young
experimenter will derive fully as much pleasure in
constructing one as from the construction of an electric motor.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>Various forms of electric engines were made before
the first practical electric motor was invented. They
amounted to little more than curiosities however, and
could only be used where the expense of electric
current was not to be regarded.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The engine illustrated in Figure 50 is of the double
action type. It is provided with two electromagnets
arranged so that one pulls the armature forward and
the other pulls it back. The motion of the armature
is transmitted to the shaft by means of a connecting
rod and crank. It is very simple to build and the
design is such that it will operate equally well whether
it is made large or small. If you do not happen to
have all the necessary materials to build an engine
according to the dimensions shown in the drawings,
you can make it just one-half that size, and it will
work equally well although it will, of course, not give
as much power.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>The complete engine is shown in Figure 50. All the
various parts have been marked so that you can easily
identify them in the other drawings. It is well to
study this illustration carefully so that you will
understand just how all the parts are arranged.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Base</strong><span> is illustrated in Figure 51. It is made of
a piece of hardwood, seven inches long, three and
one-half inches wide, and one-half an inch thick.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Electromagnets</strong><span> will largely determine the
dimensions of the rest of the engine. The magnets
shown in Figure 52 are made of three-eighths inch
round iron two and one-half inches long, provided
with two fibre washers one and one-eighths inches in
diameter. On end of each of the steel cores is drilled
and tapped to received an 8-32 screw. The
experimenter may possibly be able to secure some old
magnet cores fitted with fibre heads from an old
telephone bell or "ringer" as they are sometimes called.
A suitable bolt may be made to serve the purpose by
cutting it off to the right dimensions with a hack saw.
If a drill and tap are not available for drilling and
tapping the end so that the core can be properly
mounted in the frame of the engine, it is possible, to
use the threaded portion of a bolt to good advantage,
by the exercise of a little ingenuity. The hole in the
frame should then be made larger so that the end of
the bolt will slip through, instead of an 8-32 screw and
the core clamped in position by a nut on each side.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The fibre washers are spaced two and one-sixteenth
inches apart. The space in between should be wound
full of No. 18 B. &amp; S. Gauge cotton covered magnet
wire. Before winding in the wire, cover the core with
a layer of paper so that the wire does not touch the
metal. The ends of the wire should be led out through
small holes in the fibre heads.</span></p>

<p class="pnext"><span>It is not absolutely necessary to use No. 18 B. &amp;.S.
Gauge wire in winding the magnets, but it is the size
which will give the best results on the average battery.
If you use larger wire, the engine will require more
current from the battery. If you use finer wire, a
battery of higher voltage will be necessary. The
current consumption will, however be less.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The electromagnets are mounted in the frame of the
engine by means of two screws passing through the
holes E and D. The details of the frame are
illustrated in figure 53. It is made of a strip of wrought
iron or cold rolled steel, five and five-eighths inches
long, an inch and one-eighth wide and one-eighth inch
thick.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The material for making this part of the engine and
also the bearings can best be obtained at some
blacksmith shop or hardware store. Heavy galvanized
iron can be used but it is not usually thick enough, and
it may be necessary to use two thicknesses. The ends
of the strip are rounded and bent at right angles so
as to form a U-shaped piece with sides one and
three-quarters inches high.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The holes, "D" and "E", should be large enough to
pass an 8-32 screw. The holes, "A", "B" and "C"
should be about one-eighth of an inch in diameter.
They are used to pass the screws which hold the frame
of the engine to the wooden base.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Shaft</strong><span> will probably prove the most difficult part
of the engine to make properly. The details are given
in Figure 55. It is made of a piece of one-eighth inch
steel rod bent so that a crank is formed in the middle.
The crank should be bent so that it has a "throw" of
one-half an inch, that is, offset one-quarter of an inch
so that the connecting rod moves back and forth a
distance of one-half an inch. The finished shaft should
be three inches long. The piece of steel used should
be longer than this and so that it can be cut off to
exact dimensions after the shaft is finished. A second
crank should be bent in one end of this so as to form
an offset contact for the brushes. This second crank
will have to be at right angles to the first one and
should be much smaller. The ends of the shaft are
turned or filed down to a diameter of
three-thirty-seconds of an inch for a distance of about the same
amount so that they will fit in the bearing holes and
turn freely, but not allow the shaft to slip through.
The work of making the shaft will require a small vise,
a light hammer, files and a couple of pliers. One pair
of pliers should be of the round nosed type and the
other a pair of ordinary square jawed side cutters.
It may require two or three attempts before a perfect
shaft is secured. When finished, it should be
perfectly true and turn freely in the bearings. The
bearings can be adjusted slightly by bending, so that the
shaft will fit in the holes and be free, but yet not loose
enough to slip out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Armature</strong><span> is a strip of soft iron, two and
one-eighth inches long, seven-sixteenths of an inch wide
and three-sixteenths of an inch thick. A one-sixteenth
inch slot, three-eighths of an inch long is cut in one
end. A one-sixteenth inch hole is drilled through
from one side to the other, one-eighth of an inch from
each end. The hole which passes through the slot is
used tu pass the pin which pivots the armature to the
connecting rod. The other hole is used to mount the
armature in its bearing. The armature bearing is a
small edition of the one which is used to support the
engine shaft. The details and the dimensions are given
in the lower left hand side of Figure 56. The armature
is shown in the center of the same illustration. The
connecting rod is illustrated at the right. This is made
from a strip of three-sixty-fourths inch brass, three
sixteenths of an inch wide and one and five-eighths
inches long. The one-eighth inch hole should be
drilled close to one end and a one-sixteenth inch hole
close to the other.</span></p>

is hard fibre. It is one and five-eighths inches long
and three-eighths of an inch square.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It may be possible to secure a flywheel for the engine
from some old toy. It should be about three and
one-half inches in diameter. A flywheel can be made out
of sheet iron or steel by following the suggestion in
Figure 58, which shows a wheel cut out of one-eighth
inch sheet steel. It is given the appearance of having
spokes by boring six three-quarter inch holes through
the face as shown. The hole in the center of the wheel
should be one-eighth of an inch in diameter. The
wheel is slipped over the shaft and fastened in position
by soldering.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The parts are now all ready to assemble into the
complete engine. Mount the electromagnets in the
frame and fasten the frame down to the wooden base
so that one end of the frame comes practically flush
with the left hand edge of the base. Fasten the
bearing across the frame at right angles by a screw passing
through the center hole in the bottom of the bearing
through the hole A and into the base. The bottom of
the bearing should be bent slightly so as to straddle
the frame. The bearing should be secured and
prevented from turning or twisting by two screws passed
through the other two holes in the bottom Use round
headed wood screws in mounting the bearing and
the frame.</span></p>

Run the other terminal of the electromagnet to the

terminal of the left hand electromagnet to the other

minor adjustments, the engine is now ready to run.
Connect two or three cells of dry battery to the two
binding posts and turn the flywheel so that it moves
from right to left across the top. Just as the crank
passes "dead center" and the armature starts to move
back away from the left hand magnet, the small
contact crank on the shaft should touch the left hand
brush and send the current through the right hand
magnet. This will draw the armature over to the
right. Just before the armature gets all the way over
to the right, the contact should break connection with
the left hand brush and interrupt the current so that
the inertia of the flywheel will cause it to keep moving
and the armature to start to move over toward the
left hand magnet at which point the contact on the
shaft should commence to bear against the right hand
brush, thus throwing the left hand magnet into
circuit and drawing the armature over to that side. If
the brushes and the cranks are in proper relation to
each other the engine will continue to repeat this

<h2 class="level-2 pfirst section-title title"><span>CHAPTER IV SMALL POWER MOTORS</span></h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span>In order for a motor to develop any appreciable
amount of power it must be much larger than any
of those which have been described in these pages so
far, and must be constructed in a most painstaking
manner. It will be necessary to use a great deal more
iron in the field and armature and also to make the
space between them as small as possible. A motor
having a small separation between the field poles and
the armature will develop more power than one having
a greater separation.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>The most efficient types of small power motors have
laminated field and armature frames, that is, they are
built up of a large number of thin metal punchings.
The amateur experimenter who has limited facilities
for carrying out his work would find it difficult to
make parts of this sort to good advantage and so the
motors described here have been designed with cast
iron armatures and field frames.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Those who wish to secure a set of castings from
their own patterns can possibly save part of the
expense if they do not consider the extra labor of first
making the patterns.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two types of motors are described, one vertical and
the other horizontal. Both are intended to operate on
a battery current of 3-6 volts and if carefully built
will deliver a surprising amount of power.</span></p>

<h3 class="level-3 pfirst section-title title"><span>A VERTICAL POWER MOTOR</span></h3>
<p class="pfirst"><strong class="bold">The Field Frame</strong><span> is shown in detail in Figure 60.
The exact shape and dimensions are best understood
by a careful examination of the drawing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The pattern for the field may be made of the same
shape and practically the same size as indicated for
the finished casting because the "rapping" or jarring
which the pattern will receive in the foundry in order
to free it from the sand mould will enlarge the mould
sufficiently in a casting of small size to make up for
any shrinkage which takes place upon the cooling of
the iron.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The only exception to this is in the tunnel where
the armature rotates. This should measure one and
three-quarter inches in diameter when finished and
should be slightly smaller in the rough casting so that
there is enough material to allow for truing and
bringing to equal size.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Armature</strong><span> may be of two types, three pole or
six pole. The three-pole armature is the simpler, but
the six-pole type is the smoother running and gives
the steadier power. The details and dimensions are
shown in Figures 61 and 62. One of the armatures
should be selected and a pattern built.</span></p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 100%" id="figure-912">

<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">FIG. 61.—Three-pole Armature.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the patterns are finished they should be given
a coat of shellac and carefully rubbed with fine
sandpaper so that they are perfectly smooth. Otherwise
the sand is liable to stick in moulding and produce an
imperfect casting.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Castings may be obtained from any foundry which
is equipped to make grey iron castings. They should
be as soft as possible. The cost will depend upon the
quantity which are ordered. If only one set is
required, the charge will probably be based upon the
time required for making the moulds but if several
sets are ordered the price may be based upon the
weight.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the castings have been received from the
foundry, the first operation is to carefully remove all
rough spots and burrs with a file.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Those who have a lathe or large drill press can
easily finish the tunnel by turning or reaming. In
the absence of these facilities, hand filing can be made
to suffice, if carefully done.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The holes marked "BBBB" should be drilled with
a No. 29 drill and tapped 8-32. These holes must be
very carefully located because they serve to fasten the
bearings. Each hole should be exactly opposite the
other, two and five-sixteenth inches apart and on a
line passing exactly through the centre of the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The holes, "PP" and "SS", are three-sixteenths of
an inch in diameter. The former support the Binding
Posts and the latter pass the screws which fasten
the motor to the wooden base.</span></p>

<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">FIG. 62.—Six-pole Armature.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>The armature, in the case of either the six or three
pole type, has a three-sixteenth inch hole drilled along
the axis to accommodate a steel shaft of the same
diameter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The armature casting should be accurately turned
to a diameter of one and twenty-three thirty-seconds
of an inch so that it will revolve in the tunnel
without touching the field but still be very close to it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Two holes bored through one of the pole pieces at
right angles to the shaft with a No. 37 drill and
threaded with a 6-32 tap will allow the armature to
be clamped tightly to the shaft with two headless set
screws.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Field Winding</strong><span> consists of No. 16 double cotton
insulated wire. Before the winding is put on, the core
should be insulated with one or two layers of shellaced
paper. Two circular pieces of shellaced paper should
be placed against the flanges at the end of the
core, so that the winding space is thoroughly
insulated and there is no liability of the wire touching the
iron at any point. The wire should be wound in smooth
even layers. The winding space is completely filled.
The outside layer may be finished by a coat of shellac.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The three-pole armature is much easier to wind than
the six pole type. The wire used should be No. 24
B. &amp; S. Gauge, double cotton covered. Before the
wire is wound on, cover the winding space with
shellaced paper so that the wire will not touch the
iron at any point. Each coil should be wound in the
same direction as the others starting at the same end
and as close as possible to the inside.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>The outside end of each coil should be connected
to the inside of the next coil as shown in Figure 63.
The diagram indicates only one layer of wire in each
coil for the sake of clearness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The winding upon the armature shown in Figure
64 is divided into six coils. Each coil consists of as
many turns as possible of No. 24 B. &amp; S. Gauge, cotton
covered wire to fill the space completely and all coils
are wound in the same direction. The illustrations
show the various stages of the bindings with the two,
four and six coils in place. The winding spaces on
the armature should be carefully insulated with
shellaced paper before the coils are placed in position.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After the winding has been finished the next step
is to make the shaft and commutator. The shaft is a
piece of three-sixteenths steel, three and one-quarter
inches long. The shaft passes through the centre of
the armature and is locked-in position by the two set
screws.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">The Commutator</strong><span> is probably one of the most
difficult parts of the motor to make. It consists of three
circular brass sections insulated from one another on
a fibre bushing.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The fibre bushing is a hollow cylinder,
five-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and seventeen
thirty-seconds of an inch long. The bushing should force
tightly on the shaft. The segments are make by
turning a piece of three-quarter inch brass rod in a lathe
until it is one-half an inch in diameter for a distance of
about seven-sixteenths of an inch. A five-sixteenths
inch hole should be bored through the center so that
it will fit tightly upon the fibre bushing.</span></p>

<span class="italics">FIG. 64.—Showing how the Coils on a Six-pole Armature are arranged and connected.</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then cut the brass off one-half inch from the end
so that it leaves a flange at one end, three-quarters of
an inch in diameter. Saw it lengthwise into three
equal parts and mount it upon the fibre bushing with
a small strip of mica between each two sections to
fill in the space made by the saw cuts. The sections
are held together by a fibre ring, three quarters of an
inch in diameter outside and one-half an inch in
diameter inside. The ring should fit very tightly over
the commutator and be forced down flush against the
shoulder. After the ring is in position, file any mica
which may project out of the slots down even with
the surface of the segments and force the commutator
onto the shaft with the shoulder against the armature.
The commutator must fit very tightly so that there
is not any possibility of moving it after it is in position.</span></p>

six pole armature respectively.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>This is the age of electricity. The most fascinating of all
books for a boy must therefore be one dealing with the
mystery of this ancient force and modern wonder, even a
mere list of whose services is impossible. The best qualified
of experts to instruct boys, Alfred P. Morgan, has in a book
far superior to any other of its kind told not only how to
make all kinds of motors, telegraphs, telephones, batteries,
etc., and to do so economically, but has explained the principles
upon which these depend for operation, and how the
same thing is done in the every-day world be well
presented and so attractive is this really great book that it will
be an education for any bright boy to have it, as well as
the best kind of a moral safeguard, by leaving no time or
thought for evil, and a means of future benefit beyond the
power of any one to reckon. Glancing over the pages of
this book, one cannot but be impressed by the excellent
illustrations, clearness of expression and the large number
of subjects that are covered. It is beyond doubt the best
book in this line that has ever been written or published.
It is a book that will delight every boy who has a leaning
towards electrical experiments. The author writes in a clear
and chatty style and while he has a thorough
technical knowledge of his subject he has succeeded
in treating it in a simple manner
so that it is readily intelligible to his young readers.</span></p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by

<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">1.B.</strong><span> “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic
works. See paragraph 1.E below.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><strong class="bold">1.C.</strong><span> The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free
access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works
in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project
Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with
the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format
with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you share it
without charge with others.</span></p>

of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work.  The Foundation makes no

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain

the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
